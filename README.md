# pdf-chat-app
This repository hosts a Language Model (LLM) powered chatbot that can understand and answer questions based on the content of an uploaded PDF file. The app is built using Streamlit, LangChain, and HuggingFace LLM models. The app uses the HuggingFace Instruct embeddings to understand the content of the PDF and answer the user's queries.
